                <h2>Cats - The Rum Tum Tugger Lyrics (cut off)</h2>
                <p>The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat</p>
                <p>If you offer me pheasant, I'd rather have grouse</p>
                <p>If you put me in a house, I would much prefer a flat</p>
                <p>If you put me in a flat, then I'd rather have a house</p>
                <p>If you set me on a mouse, then I only want a rat</p>
                <p class="break">If you set me on a rat, then I'd rather chase a mouse</p>
                <p>The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat</p>
                <p>And there isn't any need for me to shout it</p>
                <p>For he will do as he did, do</p>
                <p class="break">And there's no doing anything about it</p>
                <p>The Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore</p>
                <p>Oh, when you let me in, then I want to go out</p>
                <p>I'm always on the wrong side of every door</p>
                <p>As soon as I'm at home, then I'd like to get about</p>
                <p>I like to lie in the bureau drawer</p>
                <p class="break">And I make such a fuss if I can't get out</p>
                <p>The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat</p>
                <p>And there isn't any need for you to doubt it</p> 
                <p>For he will do as he did, do</p>
                <p>And there's no doing anything about it</p>
